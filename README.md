# Optimally Regularised Least Squares Support Vector Machine
This is a fast tuned  Least Squares Support Vector Machines (LSSVM), the cost of regularisation is O(n^2)   (please see reference below).\

# Running the demo files
* chdir to demo then run the scripts, otherwise path errors.
* Same for testing chdir into test and run pytest
